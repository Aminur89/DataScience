													<h3>Unit 1: Introduction To Data Science</h3>
												</header>
												<p>This first unit provided a fascinating glimpse into the world of data science.  I was particularly interested in learning about the role of a data scientist and the diverse skillset they require.  The idea that data science is considered one of the top emerging roles for the future really resonated with me, and it solidified my desire to delve deeper into this field. </p>
												<p> The concept of the 4th paradigm of science, where data analysis plays a central role in scientific discovery, felt like a significant shift.  It highlights the immense potential of data science to transform various industries.  Understanding the interplay between big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence was another key takeaway.  These areas seem intricately linked, with big data providing the fuel for machine learning algorithms, which in turn contribute to the advancement of AI.</p>
												<p> This unit also sparked some concerns about the potential impact of big data on society.  The vast amount of data collected raises questions about privacy and data governance.  Finding a balance between harnessing the power of data and protecting individual privacy seems crucial.</p>
												
												<ul class="actions">
												<details class="button">
												<p>Having the opportunity to use Jupyter Notebook was a valuable learning experience.  While initially unfamiliar with the interface, familiarizing myself with its functionalities felt like a good first step towards becoming comfortable with data science tools.</p>
												<p>Overall, this unit has been a stimulating introduction to data science.  It has ignited my passion for this field and solidified my desire to acquire the necessary skills to become a data professional.</p>

													<h3>Unit 2: The Data Management Lifecycle (DML)</h3>
												</header>
												<p>This unit on DML provided valuable insights into the critical stages of data handling, from its initial collection to its eventual destruction. Understanding the different steps in this lifecycle is essential for ensuring data accuracy, security, and compliance with regulations like GDPR.</p>
												<p>The unit effectively highlighted the paradigm shift brought about by GDPR. The regulation places ownership and control of personal data firmly in the hands of individuals, requiring organizations to act as responsible stewards. This necessitates a reevaluation of our current data collection practices.</p>
												<p>The unit also emphasized the growing threat of data breaches and the crucial role of data centers in securing sensitive information. This resonates with the recent news of [Mention a recent data breach incident] which underscores the importance of robust data security measures.  In our organization, we can explore additional data encryption methods and invest in employee training to raise awareness of cyber threats.</p>

													<h3>Unit 3: Vulnerability Assessments</h3>
												</header>
												<p>Throughout this unit, I had the opportunity to reflect on the previous two units and lessons learnt and practised such security-related concepts to undertake <a href="https://github.com/marianne-manaog/ns-module-activities/tree/main/scanning_activity">this scanning activity</a>. Furthermore, I provided <a href="https://github.com/marianne-manaog/ns-module-activities/blob/main/collaborative_discussions/Summary_post_network_security_unit_3.docx">this summary post</a> to conclude the previous collaborative discussion, by blending the knowledge I gathered from my independent research and that learnt from my peers. I also carried out an assignment on a vulnerability audit and assessment, thus outlining a detailed baseline analysis and plan. Click ‘LEARN MORE’ below to read it.</p>

													<h3>Unit 4: Breach Analysis and Mitigation</h3>
												</header>
												<p>During this unit, I had the chance to apply lessons learnt from previous units to conduct a breach analysis and outline recommendations to mitigate any identified breaches. Moreover, as per <a href="https://github.com/marianne-manaog/ns-module-activities/blob/main/collaborative_discussions/Initial_post_collab_discussion_2_network_security.docx">this post</a>, I participated in a collaborative discussion to describe the pros and cons of logging, analysing the impact of security vulnerabilities in open-source software, such as Log4j, and strategies to detect them proactively.
