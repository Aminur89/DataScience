													<h3>Unit 1: Introduction to Research Methods and Ethics in Computing</h3>
												</header>
												<p>In this unit, I explored the foundations of research methods, focusing on the scientific method and the ethical considerations essential to responsible research. I learned about the purpose of research—whether to explore, describe, or explain—and how reasoning types, deductive and inductive, play a role in forming and testing hypotheses. This unit also emphasized the importance of ethics in research, particularly when human participants are involved, with principles like respect, beneficence, and justice outlined in the Menlo Report (Finn & Shilton, 2023). Additionally, I examined how generative AI is reshaping the field of computing, as discussed by Correa et al. (2023) and Deckard (2023). This has underscored the need for global AI governance standards to address legal, social, and professional impacts. Overall, Unit 1 has laid a strong foundation for understanding the ethical and methodological principles that will guide my research practice.</p>

													<h3>Unit 2: Research Questions, the Literature Review and the Research Proposal</h3>
												</header>
												
												<p>In Unit 2, I explored the key elements of developing a research proposal, starting with formulating a well-defined research question. As Boza (2022) mentions, choosing a research topic can initially feel overwhelming, but defining a focused question is essential for successful research. I learned the importance of revising and refining questions to create a strong foundation for the research proposal.</p>
												<p>Another key aspect was understanding the literature review process. A literature review surveys scholarly sources on a topic, helping identify key theories, research gaps, and relevant methodologies. This unit emphasized structuring a review effectively to support my research question. Moving forward, I will draft an outline for my literature review based on a chosen topic, which will also inform my research proposal.</p>
												<p>In addition, I actively engaged with my peers by providing three responses in the discussion forum. This helped me gain new perspectives on research methodologies and allowed me to offer constructive feedback.</p>

													<h3>Unit 3: Methodology and Research Methods</h3>
												</header>
												
																								
												<ul>
												    <p>In Unit 3, I explored different research methodologies and methods essential for structuring my research project. Understanding research design—whether exploratory or conclusive—was foundational in identifying how to approach my topic. As Saunders et al. (2023) emphasized, every methodological choice is rooted in underlying assumptions about reality, knowledge, and values, shaping how we interpret our findings.</p>
												    <p>I also learned about qualitative, quantitative, and mixed-methods research, each with specific tools for data collection, such as interviews, surveys, and observations. This unit emphasized the importance of choosing methods suited to my research question and the type of data needed, which will be crucial for my project. I completed a summary post in Unit 1’s discussion forum, reflecting on my initial post and integrating the feedback from my peers, which helped me gain more clarity and improve my analysis.</p>
												    <p>Additionally, I reviewed two academic papers on a computing topic using different research methods, preparing for a peer review discussion. This activity was invaluable for critically evaluating research designs and understanding their applicability to various research objectives.</p>

													<h3>Unit 4: Case Studies, Focus Groups, and Observations</h3>
												</header>
												
												
												<ul>
												<p>In Unit 4, I explored various qualitative and quantitative data collection methods, including case studies, focus groups, and observations. Each method provides unique insights, depending on the research objectives. Case studies allow for in-depth exploration of phenomena but may suffer from bias and limited generalizability. Focus groups are effective for gathering diverse perspectives, provided participants share relevant backgrounds and experiences. Observations, both qualitative and quantitative, offer rich data on behaviors and trends but require careful planning to ensure validity and reliability.

</p>
												<p>This unit highlighted the importance of selecting appropriate methods tailored to the research question. I also participated in the seminar on privacy case studies, where I analyzed ethical dilemmas surrounding data access and use, which enhanced my understanding of applying these methods responsibly. Additionally, I submitted a brief outline for my literature review, receiving formative feedback to refine my research.</p>

													<h3>Unit 5: Interviews, Survey Methods, and Questionnaire Design</h3>
												</header>
												<p>In Unit 5, I explored interviews, surveys, and questionnaires as essential tools for data collection in research. Interviews allow for in-depth, qualitative insights through one-on-one conversations, while surveys are a broader quantitative method for gathering and analyzing data (Fowler, 2013). I learned the distinction between surveys and questionnaires—a survey involves the entire data collection process, whereas a questionnaire refers specifically to the set of questions used in a survey (Bradburn, Sudman & Wansink, 2004).</p>
												<p>This unit emphasized the importance of designing effective questionnaires, tailored to the type of research being conducted—quantitative, qualitative, or mixed methods. The design process involves selecting appropriate question types (open or closed), ensuring clarity and relevance, and minimizing bias. Additionally, pre- and post-testing methods were introduced as useful tools for capturing a "before-and-after" perspective in research (Bradburn, Sudman & Wansink, 2004).</p>
												<p>A key takeaway was the case study on Cambridge Analytica, which highlighted ethical concerns regarding the misuse of survey data. This case underscored the need for transparency and adherence to ethical guidelines in designing and conducting surveys (Confessore, 2018). I also reflected on how these data collection tools would be applicable to my own research and documented my findings in my e-Portfolio.</p>

													<h3>Unit 6: Quantitative Methods - Descriptive and Inferential Statistics </h3>
												</header>
												<p>In Unit 6, I explored quantitative methods and their application in analyzing data numerically. This unit focused on understanding relationships between variables and how descriptive statistics can summarize data meaningfully (Field, 2017). I learned about key measures of location, such as the mean and median, which represent the “typical” observation, and measures of spread, such as variance and standard deviation, which reflect data variability (Levine, Stephan & Szabat, 2020).</p>
												<p>The unit introduced different levels of measurement—nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio—which are essential in choosing appropriate statistical methods (Field, 2017). It also emphasized the importance of graphical and numerical summaries to present data effectively, laying a foundation for future topics like data visualization in Unit 8 (Levine, Stephan & Szabat, 2020).</p>
												<p>This learning has reinforced my ability to apply descriptive statistics and identify levels of measurement, which will be critical in analyzing data for my research projects.</p>
