													<h3>Unit 5: Interviews, Survey Methods, and Questionnaire Design</h3>
												</header>
												<p>In Unit 5, I explored interviews, surveys, and questionnaires as essential tools for data collection in research. Interviews allow for in-depth, qualitative insights through one-on-one conversations, while surveys are a broader quantitative method for gathering and analyzing data (Fowler, 2013). I learned the distinction between surveys and questionnaires—a survey involves the entire data collection process, whereas a questionnaire refers specifically to the set of questions used in a survey (Bradburn, Sudman & Wansink, 2004).</p>
												<p>This unit emphasized the importance of designing effective questionnaires, tailored to the type of research being conducted—quantitative, qualitative, or mixed methods. The design process involves selecting appropriate question types (open or closed), ensuring clarity and relevance, and minimizing bias. Additionally, pre- and post-testing methods were introduced as useful tools for capturing a "before-and-after" perspective in research (Bradburn, Sudman & Wansink, 2004).</p>
												<p>A key takeaway was the case study on Cambridge Analytica, which highlighted ethical concerns regarding the misuse of survey data. This case underscored the need for transparency and adherence to ethical guidelines in designing and conducting surveys (Confessore, 2018). I also reflected on how these data collection tools would be applicable to my own research and documented my findings in my e-Portfolio.</p>
