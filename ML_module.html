													<h3>Unit 4: Linear Regression with Scikit-Learn </h3>
												</header>
												
												
												<ul>
												<p>In this unit, I explored linear regression using Scikit-Learn and practiced applying the fundamentals of regression modeling. I began by running the step-by-step demo correlation_regression_fuelconsumption.ipynb using the FuelConsumption dataset. This activity allowed me to directly connect the theoretical concepts from previous units with practical implementation in Jupyter Notebook and Google Colab. I experimented with data points to see how they influenced correlation and regression outcomes.</p>
												<p>I then tackled a more advanced task using the Global_Population.csv and Global_GDP.csv datasets. In Task A, I pre-processed the data to handle missing values and calculated the mean population and mean per capita GDP of each country (2001-2021). By investigating the correlation between these variables, I learned to interpret the generated plots and evaluated the Pearson Correlation Coefficient.</p>

												<p>In Task B, I performed linear regression with the mean population as the independent variable and the mean per capita GDP as the dependent variable. This hands-on experience deepened my understanding of linear regression's real-world applications, especially in socioeconomic analysis. I also had the chance to review and discuss my results with my team, reinforcing the importance of collaboration in data science projects.</p>

													<h3>Unit 6: Clustering with Python </h3>
												</header>
												<h3>K-Means Clustering</h3>
												<p>In this unit, I explored the K-Means clustering algorithm, focusing on how it groups data points based on their similarities. Using Python libraries like Scikit-Learn, I applied clustering techniques to different datasets and evaluated how well the algorithm performed with various numbers of clusters (K).</p>
												<ul>
													<li><h6>Task A: Iris Data</h6>
													I applied K-Means clustering on the famous Iris dataset, removing certain columns to focus on the features that influence Euclidean distance calculations. I experimented with different values of K, including K=3, and compared the resulting clusters with the known species labels (setosa, versicolor, virginica). This task helped me understand how the algorithm identifies patterns within the data, and how well it aligns with pre-defined categories.</li>
													<li><h6>Task B: Wine Data</h6> I performed K-Means clustering on the Wine dataset, which involved pre-processing the data by removing irrelevant columns. Like in Task A, I experimented with multiple values of K, including K=3. I then compared the clusters to the wine class labels (1, 2, and 3), which provided insight into how K-Means can be used in more complex datasets and the importance of proper pre-processing.</li>
													<li><h6>Task C: WeatherAUS Data</h6> For the WeatherAUS dataset, I explored clustering by varying K between 2 and 6, visualizing the results using scatter plots. This task gave me a better understanding of how different cluster numbers affect the outcome and how to visualize and interpret clustering results in real-world datasets.</li>
													
												</ul>
												<p>Through these tasks, I enhanced my ability to perform clustering analysis on various datasets, evaluate the clustering effectiveness, and understand the significance of choosing the right value of K. Additionally, this unit highlighted the importance of pre-processing and data cleaning when working with real-world datasets.</p>
												<h3>Team Assignment: Airbnb Business Analysis</h3>
												<p>This unit also included a team assignment, which accounted for 20% of our final module mark and involved analyzing Airbnb's NYC dataset from 2019. The assignment was divided into three tasks:</p>
												<ul>
													<li><h6>Task 1: Business Analytic Question</h6> 
													As a team, we formulated an interesting business question based on the Airbnb dataset. For example, we explored whether there were noticeable differences in bookings among different neighborhoods and the potential reasons for these differences. The question was designed to be relevant to Airbnb’s business goals and provide actionable insights.</li>
													<li><h6>Task 2: Data Analysis</h6> We then used data analytics skills to answer our chosen question. This involved performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, and applying statistics-based data analysis, including clustering, to uncover patterns. We visualized key findings to make the results more interpretable for stakeholders.</li>
													<li><h6>Task 3: Analytical Report</h6> Finally, we prepared a concise analytical report summarizing our findings, keeping it within the 2-page (1000-word) limit. The report included visualization charts and graphs to clearly convey insights to Airbnb’s executive board members.</li>
													
												</ul>
												<p>This unit strengthened my skills in both unsupervised machine learning and data analysis, while also emphasizing the importance of teamwork, succinct communication, and presenting complex findings in an understandable way for non-technical stakeholders.</p>
