													<h3>Unit 7: Constructing Normalised Tables and Database Build</h3>
												</header>
												<ul>
													<p>This week explored data normalization, transforming an unnormalized table into a 3NF model. We learned about data relationships, normalization techniques (1NF, 2NF, 3NF), and constraints for data integrity.</p>
													<p>Building a relational database solidified our understanding of normalized data. Key takeaways include:</p>
													<li>Importance of normalization for efficient databases.</li>
													<li>Identifying functional dependencies for effective normalization.</li>
													<li>Designing relational database models.</li>
													<br/>
												
													<p>I look forward to exploring complex database design, querying, and different database systems.</p>
												</ul>
											<details>
												<summary>Normalisation Task</summary>
												<h4>Unnormalized Data</h4>
												<p>The table provided shows that there are repeating groups for Course Name, Exam Boards, and Teacher Name within the records of each student. Each of these groups is related but does not conform to the requirements of a relation in first normal form (1NF).</p>
												<h4>First Normal Form (1NF)</h4>
												<p>To convert to 1NF, we need to remove repeating groups and ensure that each field contains only atomic values:</p>
												<ul>
													<li><b>Remove repeating groups:</b> We must ensure that each field contains only one value.</li>
													<li><b>Ensure each row is unique:</b> Introduce a composite primary key if necessary, which could be a combination of Student Number and Course Name.</li>
												</ul>
												<h5>Resulting 1NF Table:</h5>
												<img src="Dechipering Big Data/1NF Table.PNG" />
												<h4>Second Normal Form (2NF)</h4>
												<p>To reach 2NF, we must remove partial dependencies of non-key attributes on the primary key.</p>
												<p><b>Remove partial dependencies:</b> Separate the data into multiple tables to ensure that each non-key attribute is fully functionally dependent on the primary key.</p>
												<img src="Dechipering Big Data/2NF Tables.PNG" />
												<h4>Third Normal Form (3NF)</h4>
												<p>In 3NF, we remove transitive dependencies; no non-key attribute should depend on another non-key attribute.</p>
												<p><b>Remove transitive dependencies:</b> If a non-key attribute depends on another non-key attribute, we create a separate table.</p>
												<img src="Dechipering Big Data/3NF Tables.PNG" />
												<p>Each table now contains information without redundancy, and all attributes are dependent on the primary key.</p>
											</details>
											<details>
												<summary>Data Build Task</summary>
													<h4>Introduction</h4>
													<p>With the normalization task completed, my focus shifted to constructing a relational database system that reflects the relationships and constraints inherent in the normalized data. This involved creating tables with designated primary and secondary (foreign) keys, establishing referential integrity to ensure data consistency.</p>
													<h4>Database Design</h4>
													<ul>
														<h5>Students Table</h5>
														<li><b>Student Number</b> (Primary Key): A unique identifier for each student.</li>
														<li><b>Student Name:</b> The full name of the student.</li>
														<li><b>Support:</b> Indicator of whether the student receives support.</li>
														<li><b>Date of Birth:</b> The student’s date of birth.</li>
														
														<h5>Course Table</h5>
														<li><b>Course Name</b> (Primary Key): A unique identifier for each course.</li>
														<li><b>Exam Board:</b> The exam board associated with the course.</li>

														<h5>Teachers Table</h5>
														<li><b>Teacher Name</b> (Primary Key): A unique identifier for each teacher.</li>

														<h5>Course Enrollments Table</h5>
														<li><b>Enrollment ID</b> (Primary Key): A unique identifier for each enrollment.</li>
														<li><b>Student Number</b> (Foreign Key): Links to the Students table.</li>
														<li><b>Course Name</b> (Foreign Key): Links to the Courses table.</li>
														<li><b>Exam Score:</b> The student's score for the particular course.</li>

														<h5>Course Teachers Table</h5>
														<li><b>Course Name</b> (Foreign Key): Links to the Courses table.</li>
														<li><b>Teacher Name</b> (Foreign Key): Links to the Teachers table.</li>
													</ul>
												<h4>Database Implementation</h4>
												<p>I implemented the database in an SQL-compliant database management system. The tables were created using SQL's CREATE TABLE statement, with constraints added to enforce referential integrity:</p>
												<img src="Dechipering Big Data/SQL Code.PNG" />
												<ol>
													<h4>Database Testing</h4>
													<p>To validate the database, I performed a series of insertions, updates, and deletions to test referential integrity:</p>

													<li><b>Insertion Test:</b> Attempted to insert data with non-existing foreign keys to ensure it was rejected.</li>
													<li><b>Update Test:</b> Tried to update primary key values and ensured cascading updates were handled correctly, if applicable.</li>
													<li><b>Deletion Test:</b> Attempted to delete records that would violate referential integrity to ensure the action was rejected.</li>
													
												</ol>
												<p>These tests confirmed that the database maintains referential integrity, as all inappropriate actions were prevented by the database's constraints.</p>
