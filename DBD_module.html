													<h3>Unit 1: Introduction to Big Data Technologies and Data Management</h3>
												</header>
												<p>This first unit provided a strong foundation for understanding big data and its complexities.  I found the concept of the 4Vs of big data (Volume, Variety, Velocity, Veracity) particularly helpful. It gave me a clear framework for thinking about the challenges of managing massive datasets.</p>
												<p>However, the exponential growth of data mentioned in the lecturecast was a bit overwhelming at first.  To solidify my understanding, I researched data growth statistics online and found some interactive visualizations that helped put the concept into perspective.</p>
												<p>The team project seems like an exciting opportunity to apply the concepts we learned in a practical setting.  I attended the introductory session and feel optimistic about working with my assigned team.  I believe open communication and clear division of tasks will be crucial for our success.</p>

												</br>
												
													<p>Looking ahead to Unit 2, I'm particularly interested in learning more about data types and formats.  Understanding the implementaions of Python routines and applications using APIs. Applying data formats and types in a variety of scenarios.</p>
													<p>Overall, Unit 1 provided a solid introduction to big data and its associated technologies.  The combination of lectures, readings, and hands-on activities created a well-rounded learning experience.  I'm eager to continue exploring this fascinating field in the upcoming units.</p>

													<h3>Unit 2: Introduction to Data Types and Formats</h3>
												</header>
												
												<ul class="actions">
												<h4>Key Learnings</h4>
													<li><b>Data Formats and Representations:</b> The diversity from structured to unstructured data formats emphasized the importance of adaptability in data organization.</li>
													<li><b>Data Types in Programming:</b> Focusing on Python showed how different programming languages manage data types, underlining Python’s versatility with data.</li>
													<li><b>APIs in Data Handling:</b> Practical exercises with APIs demonstrated their critical role in connecting disparate data sources efficiently.</li>
												</ul>
												<ul>
													<h4>Reflections and Applications</h4>
													<p>This unit fundamentally changed my perspective on data handling, showcasing the dynamic nature of data and the pivotal role of APIs. Python’s application in manipulating various data types has equipped me with valuable skills for real-world data processing tasks.</p>
													<P>It is also interesting to note that we were devided into two groups in the seminar of this unit for the Logical design of a database project. Which we will be submitting before end of the unit 6. </P>

													<h3>Unit 3: Data Collection and Storage</h3>
												</header>
												
																								
												<ul>
												    <h4>Key Learnings:</h4>
													<p>This unit emphasized the importance of data integrity for businesses. Accurate and reliable data is crucial for informed decision-making, marketing strategies, and overall business success. I learned about various data collection methods, including surveys, interviews, and web scraping. Each method has its strengths and weaknesses. Surveys are efficient for gathering broad opinions, while interviews provide deeper insights but are more time-consuming. Web scraping can be a valuable tool for extracting data from websites, but ethical considerations and legal restrictions need to be taken into account.</p>
												<br/>
												    <h4>Activity Reflections:</h4>
													<p>The Web Scraping activity was a practical learning experience. Initially, it was challenging to understand the code and navigate website structures. However, with practice, I was able to successfully extract the desired data. This activity solidified my understanding of how data can be collected from online sources and the importance of following proper scraping techniques.</p>
													<p>The submission in module wiki demonstrates web scraping with Python libraries beautifulsoup4 and requests to extract data containing the keyword "Data Scientist" and convert it to either JSON or XML format. The provided <a href="Dechipering Big Data/Unit 3 Web Scrapping.ipynb">code</a> offers a framework for scraping Indeed job postings, highlighting the core functionalities involved. I did scrap from <a href="https://realpython.github.io/fake-jobs/">realpython</a> and created an <a href="Dechipering Big Data/Data_Scientist.xml">XML file </a> which is attached here. For data scientist keyword, I did use <a href="https://www.totaljobs.com/jobs/data%20scientist?gclid=Cj0KCQjwq86wBhDiARIsAJhuphljN_I5RNBg5737gf0ie-XkJOVfZAHAGZBefs8B_A81ddDc9MsFyPwaAkZMEALw_wcB&ef_id=Cj0KCQjwq86wBhDiARIsAJhuphljN_I5RNBg5737gf0ie-XkJOVfZAHAGZBefs8B_A81ddDc9MsFyPwaAkZMEALw_wcB:G:s&cid=SEA_GO_UK-TJ-DIS022-GEN--E%7C%5BIncrControl%5D_c_data%20scientist-jobs-%7CJBT3483-GEN001-_data%20scientist%20jobs_RL_RSA4&s_kwcid=AL!7101!3!675571530601!e!!g!!data%20scientist%20jobs!12683864768!118783197965&gad_source=1">total Jobs.</a> The attached <a href="Dechipering Big Data/data_scientist_jobs.json">JSON file</a> exemplifies the successful extraction of 25 job titles containing "Data Scientist." This simulates the potential results we could obtain when scraping job postings.</p>

													<h3>Unit 4: Data Cleaning and Transformation</h3>
												</header>
												
												
												<ul>
												<li>
													<h4>Key Learnings:</h4>
													<br/>
													<p>This unit provided a valuable introduction to the world of data cleaning and transformation.  I learned about the importance of these processes in ensuring the quality and accuracy of data analysis.  The data management pipeline was a particularly insightful concept, as it highlighted the various stages data goes through before it's ready for analysis.  Understanding factors like missing values, inconsistencies, and duplicates was crucial, as they can significantly impact the analysis if left unaddressed.  Finally, the unit emphasized the importance of designing automated processes for data cleaning, which improves efficiency and reduces human error.</p>
												</li>
												<li>
													<h4>Impact and Challenges:</h4>
												<br/>
													<p>Data cleaning and transformation are now recognized as fundamental steps for any data analysis project.  Dirty data can lead to misleading results and ultimately hinder decision-making.  While learning about these processes, a challenging aspect was determining the most appropriate techniques for specific data issues.  For instance, deciding between imputation methods for missing values or choosing the right approach for handling outliers requires careful consideration of the data and the intended analysis.  In the future, I plan to approach these challenges by referencing best practices and experimenting with different techniques to see what yields the most accurate results for the specific dataset.</p>
